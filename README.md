## ***Custom Fonts for HavocOS - MAGISK MODULE***
Havoc OS comes loaded with a lot of custom fonts but most of them are very flashy. I used only 4-5 fonts on the regular basic.

So, I created this Magisk Module which replaces HavocFonts.apk with a lightweight version with only good/useable 16 fonts. 

This project was inspired by [More Fonts for Custom Roms](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-fonts-havoc-2-0-skydragon-t3882764).

To use this module, just flash it on the recovery.
